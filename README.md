GPU-CpHMD, developed in [ComputChem LLC](https://www.computchem.com/), is a set of tools to support the GPU version of the Continuous Constant pH Molecular Dynamics simulations in Amber software. It prepares CpHMD-ready PDB structures from protein crystal structures, stages CpHMD simulations, and generates pK<sub>a</sub> related results. Moreover, it provides a web interface to control simulation parameters, monitor processes, and visualize results. We have Docker images privately stored on AWS ECR which can run directly if `Docker` and `docker-compose` are installed properly in your local GPU-enabled machines. This repository, GPU-CpHMD-Docker, is for step-by-step instructions on how to use the Docker images.
